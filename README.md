# Ant AI 1

Variant where each ant can see the whole playing field and each other.

More realistically, but also more difficultly, would be when ants can only see
a little bit around them and have to communicate with chemical signals. Perhaps
in a next version.

## Running it

Simple: `python3 dm.py`

Changing which AI to use is done by changing the imports in dm.py, and
optionally the main simulation loop.

## Files

dm.py is the Dungeon Master; the game controller. <More documentation is TODO.>
